\subsection{Using Ethereum}
Showcasing existing DApps and interacting with them. Sending transaction and calling basic functions. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Testnet vs. mainnet 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Faucets
    \end{itemize}
    \item Gas cost
    \item Chain explorers
    \item Units
    \item Public/private keys
    \item Mnemonic phrase
    \item Measures to safely use the network
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Key storage
        \item Hot/cold storage
    \end{itemize}
    \item Gotchas in comparison to traditional client-server architecture
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Confirmation times
        \item State changes/computing in the EVM vs. retrieving data
        \item Emphasising on cost of computation (ie. iterating over data)
    \end{itemize}
    \item stablecoins
    \item \textbf{Bounty}: Setting up a wallet with Metamask and sending transactions on testnet to each other, then interacting with a contract (ie. MakerDAO)
\end{itemize}
