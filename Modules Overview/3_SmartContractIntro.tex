\subsection{Intro to Smart Contracts}
Brief intro to contract development, testing and deployment. Different tools intro
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intro to smart contract first with remix and JS VM
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Following [Solidity by Example â€” Solidity 0.6.1 documentation\\(https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.1/solidity-by-example.html)
        \item writing a basic contract together 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Transition to IDE and CLI
    \item Testing the contract with ganache
    \item Compiling SC and deploying it on testnet
    \item Tools
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Web3.js
        \item Truffle/waffle (maybe not using them for the sake of clarity)
        \item Testnets/ganache
        \item Infura
    \end{itemize}
    \item Linking basic front end (ie. react) 
    \item \textbf{Bounty}: Deploying a contract and make it possible to interact with it conveniently
\end{itemize}
